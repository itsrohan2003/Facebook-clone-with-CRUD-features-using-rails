Ruby on Rails:

Rails is the web application framework written in Ruby. It provides a solid foundation for building web applications with features like MVC architecture, built-in ORM (Active Record), and routing.
Database:

PostgreSQL is used as the database management system for this application. It stores user information, posts, comments, likes, and other essential data. However, Rails also supports other databases like MySQL or SQLite for development.
Front-End Framework or Libraries:

Front-end styling and layout are implemented using the Tailwind CSS framework. Tailwind CSS offers utility-first CSS classes for rapid UI development.
Authentication:

Devise is utilized for user authentication. It provides ready-made authentication modules for handling user registration, login, logout, and password recovery.
Rich Text Editing (Optional):

Action Text, a built-in Rails feature, is used to enable rich text editing functionality using the Trix editor. This allows users to create posts with formatted text, images, and embedded content.
File Uploads (Optional):

Active Storage, another built-in Rails feature, manages file uploads. Users can upload images and other files to their posts or profiles.
Multi-Provider Authentication (Optional):

OmniAuth is integrated to allow users to sign in using their Facebook, Google, Twitter, or other social media accounts.
Testing Framework (Optional):

RSpec is chosen as the testing framework for writing automated tests to ensure application functionality.
Deployment Platform:

Heroku is the recommended deployment platform for hosting Rails applications due to its simplicity and scalability. However, other platforms like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Linode can also be used.
